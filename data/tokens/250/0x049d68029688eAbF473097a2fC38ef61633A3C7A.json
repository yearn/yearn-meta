  "description": "Frapped USDT is an innovative cross-chain wrapper for USDT token, in collaboration between Tether and Popsicle Finance. USDT is a centralized stablecoin that mirrors the price of the U.S. dollar, issued by Hong Kong-based company Tether. The token’s peg to the USD is achieved via maintaining a sum of commercial paper, fiduciary deposits, cash, reserve repo notes, and treasury bills in reserves that is equal in USD value to the number of USDT in circulation.",
